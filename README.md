### What I did?

✅ deployed your own custom ERC-20 token <br />
✅ deployed your own ERC-1155 NFT people can mint to join your DAO. <br />
✅ deployed your own governance contract + treasury. <br />
✅ built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by your governance contract.<br />
