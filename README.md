### What I did?

âœ… deployed my own custom ERC-20 $SCAM token <br />
âœ… deployed my own ERC-1155 NFT people can mint to join your DAO. <br />
âœ… deployed my own governance contract + treasury. <br />
âœ… built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by your governance contract.<br />
